# Math Bot with Tkinter GUI
A simple desktop application that allows users to input mathematical questions and get answers using a chatbot interface.

In this repository, you'll primarily find the chatbot's code written in Python. However, on my website, Three Letter Acronym, I've also developed a version of the chatbot primarily using JavaScript, seamlessly integrated into the site's functionality. To experience this JavaScript-based chatbot version, please visit the following link: [Homepage | Three Letter Acronym](https://www.three-letter-acronym.com/).

## Features
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, etc.
- Logarithmic and exponential operations.
- Percentage calculations.
- Exponents and roots.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfajors/math-chatbot.git
2. Navigate to project directory
   ```bash

3. Run the application
   ```bash
